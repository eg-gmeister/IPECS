# IPECS

adds a cool and unnecessary system to C++ for integers

IPECS really is just some Code that has a useless and unrelated name, and really is hard to classify as something.

it boils down to a class that adds the ability to save integers as encoded strings, and then save those encoded strings to an array and a file (10 times).

a more in depth tutorial is in the other file VTS.cpp and really explains it a lot more than i do here.

it took me a while to make since im a beginner with c++ and because I didnt really have a plan with this.
